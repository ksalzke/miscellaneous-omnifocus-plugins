# Actions

## Add One Day To Due Date

This action updates the due date of the selected task(s) to one day after the existing (effective) due date.

If the task has no effective due date, the due date is set to tomorrow at the default due time set in the OmniFocus settings.

## Duplicate Tasks

This action creates a duplicate of the currently selected task(s) after the current instance in the database.

_Note that OmniFocus does have a built-in "Duplicate" function however it is disabled in custom perspectives and therefore this action can be used instead._

## Mark Completed Yesterday

This marks the selected task(s) as completed at 11:59pm of the previous day and is intended to be useful for reporting days on which tasks were completed e.g. in combination with my [Completed Task Report plugin](https://github.com/ksalzke/completed-task-report-omnifocus-plugin).

## Trim Name

This action trims any whitespace from the beginning or end of name(s) of the selected task(s).
